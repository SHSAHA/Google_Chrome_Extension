USAGE

The extension is very simplistic in nature. Just click the tomato icon which appears in your toolbar, then start the timer. When the time is up you will receive a notification.

The basics of the Pomodoro technique are as follows (and there are plenty of variations on this theme):

The time tracker is based on the pomodoro method - meaning that work is split up into
intervals of:
25 minutes of working followed by 5 minutes of break, also after a 4 pomodoros there is a larger
break.
Though as different people have different working habits all of these options should be
configurable.
* I am able to break a pomodoro during midway.
