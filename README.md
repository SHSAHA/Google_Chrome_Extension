Click 'ok'

USAGE
The extension is very simplistic in nature. Just click the tomato icon which appears in your toolbar, then start the timer. When the time is up you will receive a notification.

The basics of the Pomodoro technique are as follows (and there are plenty of variations on this theme):

Start your timer
Work!
If there are any interruptions, defer them until the timer runs out (e.g. If the phone rings, politely tell them you'll ring back in under 25 minutes).
When the timer runs out, stop your main activity and deal with any interruptions you've deferred.
Take a short break. 5 minutes is fine.
Repeat.
Every 4th iteration, take a longer break.
